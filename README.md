## About the Vultr Style Guide and Vale

This toolkit uses Vale and markdownlint to catch common writing issues. Please review all suggestions, warnings, and errors before submitting an article to Vultr Docs. These rules are not infallible. They may produce false-positives or fail to detect issues. The editors at Vultr do not automatically reject or accept articles based solely on the Markdown Toolkit reports.
