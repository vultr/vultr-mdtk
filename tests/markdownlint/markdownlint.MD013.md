# Test Case: MD013: Line Length

<https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md#md013>

The markdownlint rule **MD013** limits line length to 80 chars by default. Vultr doesn't enforce this restriction. Setting this rule to false allows unlimited line length without warnings. This line is very long and there should be no warnings on this line..
