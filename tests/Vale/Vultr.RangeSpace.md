# Test Case

    Vultr.RangeSpace

## Warning

Edit lines 20-30 configure Nginx.

## Correct

If space is an issue in a range of numbers, such as in tables, use an en dash instead of a hyphen. The example below generates a warning from rule `Vultr.Ranges` because it's preferred to use the long form.

Edit lines 20â€“30 configure Nginx.
